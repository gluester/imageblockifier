# Requires PySpigot
https://github.com/magicmq/pyspigot/

# Version
tested on 1.20.1, I don't see why it wouldn't work on other versions

# About
Turn any image into a Minecraft build 

# not done yet
- rotations (stuck facing the same direction)
- i'd like to let it figure out the color of blocks on its own
  i know you can get the color as it'd appear on a map, but I don't think there's a way to just get the color with the spigot api
  but there's a github repo with a spreadsheet containing all the colors of each block so I'll update it to use that eventually
- specifiy size in command
# notice
this is like my third pyspigot script

# Images
